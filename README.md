## OIBSIP
This repositoty invovles multiple project given to my during my internship program at Oasis Infobyte.
### Project 1 
### Data Cleaning 
It shows how I was able to clean a database by
1. Understanding the structure of the data
2. Removal of missing values
3. Removal of duplicates
4. Standardization
5. Removing outliers
6. Display the structure of the dataset and outliers using boxplot
This was done by the use of libaries such as Pandas, matplotlib, numpy in python.

### Project 2 
### Customer Segmentation Analysis
It involves anaylzing the customers behaviours and finding patterns in them by 
1. Cleaning the data
2. Performing the proper statstics needed
3. Segmenting customers based on behaviours
4. Visualizing patterns or trends found.
This was done by the use of libaries such as  Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn in Python.

### Project 3 
### Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
It is to build a predictive model using linear regression to predict the price of houses , it involved:
1. cleaning and exploring the dataset
2. Selecting the value to be predicted and its features
3. Creating your model
4. Checking the models performance
5. Visualizing the predicted vs the actual
We used alot of libaries in python to achieve this project.

Thank You.
